          </button>
          <div class = "content">
            <h2>Level Guidelines:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Levels must be under 10 seconds long to get accepted. (meaning the max length is 9.99 seconds)</strong></li>
              <li>Levels must be top 150 difficulty to get placed. (Event winners are exempt from this rule, although all levels must be harder than Bottom of the tdl at the very least)</li>
              <li>Levels must not contain gameplay that is much easier on certain hardware.</li>
              <li>The maximum allowed CPS (clicks per second) in a level is 12 for 1 player levels, and 8 per player for 2 player levels. You may not exceed these limits for more than 2 clicks at a time.</li>
              <li>Levels must have some semblance of decoration, even if it’s very simple, and taking gameplay or decoration from other levels is not allowed.</li>
              <li>Levels must be possible on vanilla GD without modifications such as Click Between Frames. FPS locks may not be locked to any framerate under 30 frames per second.</li>
              <li>Levels must not contain anything that would break the server rules if the whole level were sent as an image or a video in the server. (You can find these in the #server-rules channel in our Discord server)</li>
              <li>Levels must be on the main GD servers. (If your level is only on a private server, it will be denied)</li>
              <li>Levels must not contain repetitive gameplay for over half of the level.</li>
              <li>Do not submit levels from other lists here or levels that aren’t made for this list made by other people that aren’t in this server.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Verification and Submission Guidelines:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>To submit levels or completions, join our Discord server which is linked on the next collapsible.</li>
              <li>For platformers, all verifications and records must be done in strictly under 10 seconds, and records that exceed 10 seconds will not be accepted.</li>
              <li>Records must include audible clicks (so no mods that play a click sound on input), part of the previous attempt and its death animation (or the level being entered if the completion is on the 1st attempt), and either a fully visible endscreen or the level being exited.</li>
              <li>Noclip is not allowed, even if the noclip run went through the level without dying.</li>
              <li>Physics bypass is not allowed whatsoever, although Click Between Frames is.</li>
              <li>An FPS counter is required to be shown on screen, and if you have a mod that allows a cheat indicator, one must be shown on screen as well.</li>
              <li>Do not intentionally change your FPS mid-attempt.</li>
              <li>Do not submit a level on another person's behalf. Either the creator or verifier must submit it themselves, and the creator must be in the server when their level is submitted to the list.</li>
              <li>For levels in the top 10, both the creator and verifier must be in the server when the level is submitted.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you would like to contact any of our staff members about the list, joining our server is the easiest way to do so. At least 1 staff member is online at all times, so any questions or concerns you have will be answered by someone! You also have to be in the server to submit levels or completions, so if you have one to submit, then join the server!</p>

                  <p>I'd like to use this section of the home page to thank and credit some of the people that helped with making the development process easier, or shaped the website into how it is today, either directly or indirectly. These people include:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><h4>ThePvzProMaster</h4></li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The only other person who knew about my plans to make a new website for this list the whole time. He helped a ton with making this website look like its own thing rather than just a reskin of the GD LRR Demon List website (which I'll get to later here), by providing the background that you see behind here, and also helping with making the level cards rounded. He also provided a bunch of suggestions during the time I was making this, including a font change (Which is why this site uses Tahoma as its main font instead of Bitter). Without his help, this website would hardly look the way it does now, and I am really grateful for that.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><h4>ryan9328</h4></li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The developer of the GD LRR Demon List website, which I used to develop this website. As some people may know, I have absolutely no idea how to code, so the repository for this website being open to the public was a huge help. Without that repository, this website would have just stayed as a dream instead of a reality, and I can't thank him enough for making it public. ryan has also credited some people who helped him with developing the GD LRR Demon List site, so if you would like to see that, then click <a target = "_blank" href = "https://tinydemonlist.replit.app/credits.html">here</a>!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><h4>Epic GD</h4></li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The founder and former owner of this list. He was also the one to make the very original website for this list which was hosted on site123. While he does not own the list anymore due to other life responsibilities, I feel I still have to give credit to him for creating this list to begin with.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><h4>Chucky GD</h4></li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The developer of Geomax, which our list was on for about a year now as of writing this (July 23rd, 2025). While us being on Geomax was just intended as a partnership and nothing else, as at that point we were still using another website for the list, we had to switch to using it as the main place for our list since the start of October after one of our old websites got nuked. While Geomax was admittedly not the most reliable place to host our list on, as the site would go down every other month for up to multiple weeks at a time, if we hadn't put our list on there it would have been dead a long time ago, so in a way Chucky is directly responsible for our list still being alive now.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><h4>Zenos Sins</h4></li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The creator of the backup doc for the list, which I used to fill in the main and extended list levels when Geomax was down this month (July). Without the backup, this website would have taken quite a bit longer to finish.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><h4>Cloudy45</h4></li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The former owner of the Tiny Pemonlist (was a completely seperate list for tiny platformers). Even though the list had completely died for several months, he still kept up the website for it so I could port over some of the levels from it onto here, so thanks to him the platformer list on here started with 12 levels instead of none!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I will update this in the future if I either have forgotten anyone or if I feel the need to credit anyone else.</p>
